# SHA256 Library
A simple static _sha256_ library for use in other projects.

The actual code has come from [cgminer](https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer) which is a leaner copy of [Aaron Gifford's Implementations of SHA-256](https://www.aarongifford.com/computers/sha.html).

## Testing
For the test to run, you need [`sha256sum`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/sha2-utilities.html) in your path.
